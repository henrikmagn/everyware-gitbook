# Everyware

Everyware is a Wordpress plugin that allows you to set up a connection to Open Content. It allows for communication with the Open Content API.

Everyware will also create a custom post type called "Article", these posts will be saved in the Wordpress database along with a title \(typically the articles headline\) and the uuid of the object in Open Content. All the other data needed for displaying article pages and teasers is fetched from Open Content.
