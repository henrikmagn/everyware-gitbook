# \#3 - Content presentation

Now when we have set up the front page it would be nice to get some articles to present and read.

1. Create a structure in your board and add articles to it. 
2. Experiment with different teaser templates.
3. Use a widget to display a list of articles.

{% hint style="info" %}
Experiment with different visibilty for content depending on device and screen size.
{% endhint %}
